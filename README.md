# Edge-Detection-and-Conditional-Statistics
Detects edge of a free shear flow field such as a jet in coflow from PIV data. Conditional statistics in the frame of reference of the interface are calculated with other higher order terms and derivates such as kinetic energy budget terms, enstrophy and enstrophy flux
